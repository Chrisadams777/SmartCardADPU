# SmartCardADPU
  # # Why
  I wanted to do this so that not only would I have that type of software I needed to do the type of testing I wanted to do but to give others the ability to have the same power with out having to know any coding or having to spend a bunch of money on those hard to use and expensive programs out there

#  1. Setting Up the Project in Your IDE
# # Step 1: Create a New Java Project
Open your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.).
Create a New Project:
In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to File > New > Project.
In Eclipse: Go to File > New > Java Project.
Name your project something like SmartCardAPDU.
# # Step 2: Create the Package Structure
In the src directory of your project, create a new package named smartcard.
In IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click src > New > Package.
In Eclipse: Right-click src > New > Package.
Name it smartcard.
# #Step 3: Create the Java Files
Inside the smartcard package, create the following Java files:

DeviceManager.java
CardReader.java
APDUManager.java
GUIManager.java
ScriptEngine.java
Main.java
Copy and paste the provided code into the corresponding files:

DeviceManager.java:

// Copy and paste the code for DeviceManager.java here
CardReader.java:

// Copy and paste the code for CardReader.java here
APDUManager.java:

// Copy and paste the code for APDUManager.java here
GUIManager.java:

// Copy and paste the code for GUIManager.java here
ScriptEngine.java:

// Copy and paste the code for ScriptEngine.java here
Main.java:

// Copy and paste the code for Main.java here
# Step 4: Configure the Project (Optional)
# # Ensure that your IDE is using JDK 8 or higher:
In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to File > Project Structure and make sure the SDK is set to JDK 8 or higher.
In Eclipse: Go to Project > Properties > Java Build Path and ensure the JRE System Library is set to JavaSE-1.8 or higher.
# # Compiling and Building the Project
# Step 5: Build the Project
# # Build the project to ensure everything compiles correctly:
In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to Build > Build Project.
In Eclipse: Go to Project > Build All.
# Step 6: Resolve Any Dependencies (if needed)
The project uses standard Java libraries (javax.smartcardio, javax.swing), which are included in the JDK.
If your IDE shows any missing libraries, ensure that the JDK is correctly configured as per the instructions above.
# # Running the Project
# Step 7: Run the Main Class
To run the application, execute the Main.java class:
In IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click Main.java > Run 'Main'.
In Eclipse: Right-click Main.java > Run As > Java Application.
# Step 8: Interact with the Application
The GUI should open, allowing you to:
Send APDU commands.
Manipulate and send APDU commands.
Save communication logs.
Run scripts containing sequences of APDU commands.
Batch process multiple commands.
# Building and Packaging the Project for Distribution
# Step 9: Generate a JAR File (Optional)
If you want to create a JAR file for distribution:

In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to File > Project Structure > Artifacts > + > JAR > From modules with dependencies.
In Eclipse: Go to File > Export > Java > JAR file.
Name the JAR file (e.g., SmartCardAPDU.jar) and specify the output directory.

Select Main-Class (should be smartcard.Main) when creating the JAR.

# # Build the JAR:

In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to Build > Build Artifacts > Build.
In Eclipse: Finish the export wizard.
# Step 10: Running the JAR
You can run the JAR file from the command line:
java -jar SmartCardAPDU.jar
# # Additional Notes
JDK Version: Ensure you're using JDK 8 or higher, as it includes the javax.smartcardio package necessary for smart card communication.
Testing with Smart Card Readers: If testing with real hardware, ensure your smart card reader is connected and recognized by your system.
# # Troubleshooting
Smart Card Reader Not Found: Ensure that the device is connected and correctly installed on your system. You may need drivers for certain smart card readers.
APDU Command Errors: If the APDU command fails, double-check the command format and refer to the smart cardâ€™s documentation for valid commands.
By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Java application for managing and manipulating APDU commands with a smart card reader, complete with a GUI and scripting capabilities.
