# SmartCardADPU
  # # Why
  I wanted to do this so that not only would I have that type of software I needed to do the type of testing I wanted to do but to give others the ability to have the same power with out having to know any coding or having to spend a bunch of money on those hard to use and expensive programs out there

## Overview
SmartCardAPDU is a Java-based application designed for monitoring, manipulating, and interacting with smart card APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) commands. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) and supports scripting for automating sequences of APDU commands, making it ideal for testing and debugging smart card communication.

## Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Capture and display APDU commands as they are sent and received.
Command Manipulation: Modify APDU commands before sending them, allowing for dynamic testing scenarios.
Scripting Interface: Automate command sequences with a simple scripting interface.
Batch Processing: Execute multiple APDU commands in sequence.
Detailed Error Reporting: Comprehensive error logs with context-specific messages.
Log Saving: Save communication logs for later analysis.
## Project Structure
DeviceManager.java: Handles smart card device initialization and management.
CardReader.java: Manages reading and writing data to the smart card.
APDUManager.java: Manages APDU command transmission and error handling.
GUIManager.java: Manages the graphical user interface.
ScriptEngine.java: Parses and executes scripts containing APDU commands.
Main.java: The main entry point for the application.
## Installation
### Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher: Ensure that the JDK is installed and configured on your system.
Smart Card Reader: A compatible smart card reader connected to your system.
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartCardAPDU.git
cd SmartCardAPDU
```
### Import the Project into Your IDE
Open your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
Import the project as a Java project.
Ensure that your IDE is using JDK 8 or higher.
### Build and Run
Compile the project in your IDE:
In IntelliJ IDEA: Build > Build Project.
In Eclipse: Project > Build All.
Run the Main.java class:
In IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click Main.java > Run 'Main'.
In Eclipse: Right-click Main.java > Run As > Java Application.
## Usage
Once the application is running, the GUI will allow you to:

Send APDU Commands: Input APDU commands and send them to the smart card.
Manipulate Commands: Modify APDU commands before sending.
Save Logs: Save the communication logs for future reference.
Run Scripts: Automate sequences of APDU commands using the scripting interface.
Batch Process Commands: Execute multiple commands in one go.
## Building a JAR
To build a JAR file for distribution:

Create a JAR file using your IDE:
In IntelliJ IDEA: File > Project Structure > Artifacts > + > JAR > From modules with dependencies.
In Eclipse: File > Export > Java > JAR file.
Run the JAR file from the command line:
```Java
java -jar SmartCardAPDU.jar
```

# # Troubleshooting
Smart Card Reader Not Found: Ensure that the device is connected and correctly installed on your system. You may need drivers for certain smart card readers.
APDU Command Errors: If the APDU command fails, double-check the command format and refer to the smart cardâ€™s documentation for valid commands.
By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Java application for managing and manipulating APDU commands with a smart card reader, complete with a GUI and scripting capabilities.
